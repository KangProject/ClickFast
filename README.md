An application that tricks the user into enabling it as a device admin by having the user repeatedly press a button and popping up the add device admin dialog over it. This "exploit" is detailed at http://www.squarefree.com/2004/07/01/race-conditions-in-security-dialogs/

This application is harmless; it doesn't require any device admin permissions.
